A Custom Cobblestone Ore Generator for Minecraft Bedrock Edition!

Why choose this addons? Because this addon _does not add additional blocks and entities that must be crafted first and also don't use command block to create a custom generator! This addons does not use player.json so it'll work with other addons!_ You just need to make a cobblestone generator as usual and it will work straight away!

## Configuration
You can customize what block will appear and its chances to appear on config.js file at the script folder _(CCOG v1.0.2/scripts/config.js)_

If you already add this addons to a world and want to change the config, you need to change the config at the world behavior pack folder or you can just delete the pack folder and copy the new one with a new configuration
