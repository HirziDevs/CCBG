Customize your cobblestone generator with this addon! You can make your cobblestone generator spawn any block you want. By default, it spawns all Minecraft ores, including ancient debris, making it perfect for SkyBlock and other minigames that utilize cobblestone generators.

Why choose this addon? Because it does not add additional blocks or entities that need to be crafted first and also doesn't use command blocks to create a custom generator! This addon also does not use player.json, so it will work with other addons! You just need to make a cobblestone generator as usual, and it will work straight away! Future updates will include features such as per-dimension generators, custom tiers, and more. So stay tuned!

## Configuration
You can customize which blocks will appear and their chances to appear in the config.js file located in the script folder (CCG v1.0.2/scripts/config.js).

If you have already added this addon to a world and want to change the config, you need to update the config in the world's behavior pack folder. Alternatively, you can delete the existing pack folder and copy the new one with the updated configuration.
