Customize your cobblestone and basalt generator with this addon! You can make your cobblestone and basalt generator spawn any block you want. By default, it spawns all Minecraft ores, including ancient debris, making it perfect for SkyBlock and other minigames that utilize cobblestone and basalt generators.

Why choose this addon? Because _it does not add additional blocks or entities that need to be crafted first and also doesn't use command blocks to create a custom generator! This addon also does not use player.json, so it will work with other addons!_ You just need to **make a cobblestone and basalt generator as usual**, and it will work straight away!

## Configuration
You can customize which blocks will appear and their chances to appear in the config.js file located in the script folder (CCBG v1.0.3/scripts/config.js).

If you have already added this addon to a world and want to change the config, you need to update the config in the world's behavior pack folder. Alternatively, you can delete the existing pack folder and copy the new one with the updated configuration.

### Per Dimension Generator
You can also create a per-dimension generator, so each dimension has its own generator configuration. To enable this, simply set `config.enablePerDimensionGenerator` from `false` to `true`.
