Customize your cobblestone and basalt generator with this addon! You can make your cobblestone and basalt generator spawn any block you want. By default, it spawns all Minecraft ores, including ancient debris, making it perfect for SkyBlock and other minigames that utilize cobblestone and basalt generators.

Why choose this addon? Because _it does not add additional blocks or entities that need to be crafted first and also doesn't use command blocks to create a custom generator! This addon also does not use player.json, so it will work with other addons!_ You just need to **make a cobblestone and basalt generator as usual**, and it will work straight away!
