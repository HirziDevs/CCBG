A Custom Cobblestone Ore Generator for Minecraft Bedrock Edition!

Why choose this addons? Because this addon _does not add additional blocks and entities that must be crafted first and also don't use command block to create a custom generator! This addons does not use player.json so it'll work with other addons!_ You just need to make a cobblestone generator as usual and it will work straight away!
